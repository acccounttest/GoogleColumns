# GoogleColumns
This add g searches separated into columns(domains per files), as much you want, default is HD, use height over taskbar using chrome.


Soon:
Possibility to separate the gmap from the research page in a country, it appears sometimes the map is not clearly usable and the cross to open it in a new tab not visible at all, darkblue on dark.
But more this is often positionned between and on top of all others element groups, i know the ids to repositionnate the same parts after a drawn area to reuse it like a switch permanent or not in just a CSS script.
